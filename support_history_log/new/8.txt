Customer: Hi, I'm having issues with my email. I can't seem to receive any messages, and it's been going on for a couple of days. Can you help me fix this?

Support Engineer: I'm sorry to hear about the email issue. I'll do my best to assist you. To start, could you please provide me with your email address so I can look into the problem?

Customer: My email address is jane.doe@example.com.

Support Engineer: Thank you, Jane. Let me check the status of your email account. It appears there might be an issue with the incoming mail server settings. Can you confirm that the incoming mail server (IMAP) settings are correctly configured in your email client?

Customer: I'm using Microsoft Outlook, and I'm not sure about the settings. Can you guide me on where to find them?

Support Engineer: Certainly, Jane. In Outlook, go to File > Account Settings > Account Settings. Select your email account and click on "Change." Ensure that the incoming mail server is set to "imap.yourprovider.com" and that the port is set to 993. Also, make sure that the encryption method is set to SSL/TLS.

Customer: I'll check that right now.

Customer: It's working now! I can see my emails. Thank you so much for your help.
