Customer: Hi, I'm having issues with my email. I can't seem to send any messages, and it's showing some kind of error. Can you help me fix this?

Support Engineer: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with the email issue. Could you please provide me with the email client you're using and any specific error messages you're receiving?

Customer: I'm using the webmail interface, and the error says, "Failed to send message. Please check your internet connection and try again."

Support Engineer: Thank you for the information. Let's troubleshoot this. First, can you confirm that your internet connection is stable by opening a different website or application?

Customer: Yes, my internet is working fine. I can browse other websites without any issues.

Support Engineer: Great. Let's check the email settings. Ensure that the outgoing mail server (SMTP) settings are correct. It should be something like smtp.yourprovider.com. Also, check if the port is set to the recommended value, typically 587.

Customer: I'll check that now.

Customer: The settings seem to be correct. I'm not sure why it's still not working.

Support Engineer: No worries. Let's try a different approach. Can you try accessing your email from a different device or web browser to see if the issue persists?

Customer: I'll try it on my phone.

Customer: It's working on my phone without any issues.

Support Engineer: That's helpful information. It seems the issue might be related to the web browser on your computer. Can you try clearing the cache and cookies in your browser and then attempt to send an email again?

Customer: Sure, I'll do that right away.
