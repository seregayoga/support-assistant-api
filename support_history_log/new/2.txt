Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble setting up my new email account with your service. I keep getting an error message. Can you help me with this?

Support Engineer: Of course! I'm sorry to hear that you're facing issues with setting up your email account. To assist you better, could you please provide me with the email client you're using and any specific error messages you've encountered?

Customer: I'm using Microsoft Outlook, and the error message says something about an invalid password, but I'm sure I'm entering it correctly.

Support Engineer: Thank you for the information. Let's troubleshoot this together. First, could you double-check that there are no typos in your password? It's easy to overlook sometimes.

Customer: I've double-checked, and the password is correct. I even reset it just to be sure, but I'm still getting the same error.

Support Engineer: Alright, let's try a few more steps. Can you confirm that you have the correct incoming and outgoing server settings for our email service? I can provide you with the details if needed.

Customer: Yes, please provide me with the server settings. Maybe there's an issue there.

Support Engineer: Certainly. For incoming mail, use the IMAP server: imap.yourprovider.com, port 993. And for outgoing mail, use the SMTP server: smtp.yourprovider.com, port 587. Make sure to enable SSL/TLS for both incoming and outgoing servers.

Customer: I'll make those changes and try again.
