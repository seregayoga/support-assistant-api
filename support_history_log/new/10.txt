Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble accessing certain websites. It seems like they're blocked, but I'm not sure why. Can you help me figure this out?

Support Engineer: I'm sorry to hear that you're facing issues accessing certain websites. I'll do my best to assist you. To start, could you please provide me with the names or URLs of the websites you're having trouble accessing?

Customer: I'm unable to access social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.

Support Engineer: Thank you for letting me know. Let's check a few things. First, could you try accessing these websites from a different device, such as your phone or tablet, using the same network?

Customer: I'll try that right now.

Customer: It works on my phone. I can access the websites without any issues.

Support Engineer: That helps narrow it down. It seems the problem might be specific to your computer. Let's check your computer's network settings. Can you confirm that there's no proxy or VPN enabled that might be restricting access?

Customer: I'm not using a proxy or VPN. The settings seem normal.

Support Engineer: Okay, let's try clearing the DNS cache on your computer. This might help resolve any potential DNS-related issues. If you're using Windows, you can open Command Prompt and type "ipconfig /flushdns."

Customer: I'll try that now.
